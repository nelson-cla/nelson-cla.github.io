### I'm a second-year student in Northeastern Universityâ€™s public history MA program hoping to pursue a career
### related to museums in some capacity. Much of my experience in museums thus far has been in small- to medium-sized
### historical organizations including costumed interpretation, historical summer camp organization, exhibit 
### development, and archival work. I have also assisted the NPS Northeast Museum Service Center with event planning.
### More broadly I am interested in the questions asked about public disseminations of history and visitor studies.
